Consider a  warehouse belonging  to an online retail company that sells products to a variety of customers. Inside this
warehouse, the products are stored in 12 different locations, labeled by the following letters from A to L:



As the orders are placed by the customers online, an Autonomous Warehouse Robot is moving around the
warehouse to collect the products for future deliveries.


The 12 locations are all connected to a computer system, which is ranking in real time the priorities of
product collection for these 12 locations. F


The mission is to build an AI that will always take the shortest route to the top
priority location, whatever the location it starts from, and having the option to go by an intermediary
location which is in the top 3 priorities.
