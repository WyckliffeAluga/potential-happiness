Imagine an Online Retail Business that has million of customers. These customers are only people buying
some products on the website from time to time, getting them delivered at home. The business is doing good,
but the board of executives has decided to take some action plan to maximize revenue even more. 

This plan consists of offering to the customers the option to subscribe to a premium plan, which will give them some
benefits like reduced prices, special deals, etc. This premium plan is offered at a yearly price of $ 100, and the
goal of this online retail business is of course to get the maximum customers to subscribe to this premium plan.


The AI will be facing 9 different strategies, and it will have no idea of which is
the best one, and absolutely no prior information on any of their conversion rates. However we will make the
assumption that each of these 9 strategies does have a fixed conversion rate. These strategies were carefully
and smartly elaborated by the marketing team, and each of them has the same goal: convert the maximum
clients to the premium plan. However, these 9 strategies are all different. They have different forms, different
packages, different ads, and different special deals to convince and persuade the clients to subscribe to the
premium plan. Of course, the marketing team has no idea of which of these 9 strategies is the best one. But
they want to figure it out as soon as possible, and by saving the maximum costs, which one has the highest
conversion rate, because they know how finding and deploying that best strategy can significantly maximize
the revenues. Also, the marketing experts choose not to send an email to their 100 million customers, because
that would be costly and they would risk spamming too many customers. Instead they will subtly look for
that best strategy through online learning. 

For each customer browsing the website, only one of the 9 strategies will be deployed. Then the user will choose, or not, to take action and subscribe to the premium plan. If
the customer subscribes, it is a success, otherwise, it is a failure. The more customers we do this with, the
more feed-backs we get, and the better we could get an idea of what is the best strategy. We want to implement the
smartest algorithm that will figure out what is the best strategy in the least amount of time. And thatâ€™s for
the same two reasons: first because deploying each strategy has a cost (e.g. coming from the pop-up ad),
and second because the company wants to annoy the least customers with their ad.
